# What is a .dat wallet file?
  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, mostly based in BTC, utilize a software called <cryptoName> Core (e.g: Bitcoin Core)
  This software creates a wallet.dat file with all the private keys and addresses for your wallet. 
  This file is saved in the blockchain directory you've selected before starting to sync.
  
# What is the point of using this script?
  There are lots of lost bitcoin over the blockchain, due to people who've unfortunatelly died with their keys to people who just forgot about them.
  This script exists so you can see if the balances of the .dat file are still the ones you expect them to be.
  When the wallet.dat file is password protected, you cannot use it on bitcoin core without giving the password, which means you cannot see which addresses are inside of that wallet.
  By using this script, it will give you the chance of viewing some addresses from the wallet without requesting you for the password.
  
# Is Bitcoin private key cracking possible?
  I normally say that the impossible is just something we didn't discover possible yet!
  Cracking a bitcoin private key, in our days, seems "impossible", even so, it isn't, it's just pretty hard, hard enough to say it would be easier to win the lottery, but some people have already found some cryptos by using multiple different methods.
